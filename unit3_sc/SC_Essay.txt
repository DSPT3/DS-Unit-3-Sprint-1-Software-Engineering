- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

Remember they are human and make sure you provide at least 2 positive comments for each
piece of constructive criticsm you provide.

Some of the things I like to hear and try to provide when doing a code review:

1. Does the code meet PEP8 Guidlines

2. Can you run it locally - does it work?

3. Are there glaring problems in the existing code that could/should be fixed with changes?

4. Do you have any "why is it like this" questions that I could address by adding comments?



- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation? 

Using a container tool (i.e Docker, Red Hat) allows developers to package up an 
application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and
other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 
Using a container would definitely help to improve the situation.
